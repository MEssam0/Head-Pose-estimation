# Head-Pose-estimation
copyCodeBlock('<div>Thundercats</div>')
This project is a machine learning solution to the problem of head pose estimation. The aim is to use the X and Y coordinates of the face landmarks to determine the pitch yaw roll of head pose. The implementation uses a combination of traditional computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms.
## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You will also need to install the following dependencies:
*numpy
*scipy
*pandas
*scikit-learn
*seaborn
*mediapipe
You can install these dependencies using pip, by running the following command:
'''
CommentCell.(@pip install numpy scipy pandas scikit-learn seaborn mediapipe ).()

## Data
The data used in this project is a set of annotated face images from different angles and poses. The data can be obtained from the following sources:
*[AFLW2000](https://link-url-here.org](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/projects/3DDFA/Database/AFLW2000-3D.zip)
## Preprocessing
Before training the model, the data is preprocessed to extract the relevant features and normalize the data. The following preprocessing steps are performed:

  *Aligning the face landmarks
  *Normalizing the data
  
## Training
The model is trained using a combination of traditional computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The following steps are performed:

  *Extracting features from the preprocessed data
  *Training a regression model to predict yaw pitch roll using X and Y coordinates of the face landmarks
  *Evaluating the performance of the model on a validation set
  
## Results
The results of the model are evaluated using various metrics, including mean absolute error and r2_score.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to solve the problem of head pose estimation. By combining traditional computer vision techniques with machine learning algorithms, it is possible to achieve high accuracy in predicting pitch yaw roll of face pose. The code in this repository can serve as a starting point for building more advanced head pose estimation applications.
